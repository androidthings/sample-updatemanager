# Android Things Device Updates Sample

This application demonstrates how to interact with the device update service on
Android Things through the `UpdateManager` API. By default, the system checks for
new OTA updates every few hours and applies them automatically. This example shows
you how to configure the update policy to allow an app to take more control over
the update process and monitor progress.

> **Note:** The Android Things Console will be turned down for non-commercial
> use on January 5, 2022. For more details, see the
> [FAQ page](https://developer.android.com/things/faq).

## Pre-requisites

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+

## Getting Started

Import the project using Android Studio and deploy it to your device:

1.  Stage a new OTA update for your device using the
    [Android Things Console](https://developer.android.com/things/console/index.html).
1.  Press the **Check Now** button on the device to force a manual update check.
1.  The update status is displayed in the UI as the device downloads and verifies
    the new update.
1.  Press the **Reboot Now** button to reboot the device and complete the update
    process.

## Enable auto-launch behavior

This sample app is currently configured to launch only when deployed from your
development machine. To enable the main activity to launch automatically on boot,
add the following `intent-filter` to the app's manifest file:

```xml
<activity ...>

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    </intent-filter>

</activity>
```
